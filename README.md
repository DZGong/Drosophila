This is a repository of code written by the Drosophila group for the 2019 MBL bootcamp. 

The code intends to analyze and plot the distribution of 'cryptozoic' individuals in the woods and pastures of Kendall County, Illinois. 
The distribution of spiders, sowbugs, and weevil eggs are compared to Poisson distributions and Lagrangian Poisson Distributions (LGP) as a measure of random distribution. 

A random distribution expects a Poisson distribution, however over-dispersed distribution expects a better fit with an LGP lambda2 greather than zero, and a under-dispered distribution expects a better fit with an LGP lambda2 less than zero. 

The results are as follows:
